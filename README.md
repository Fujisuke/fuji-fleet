This project is to transfer fleet list from myfleet.moe to kancolle.wikia.com.<br />
You need to be registered in myfleet.moe if you want to use this program.<br /><br />
I have tested this project on Ubuntu 12.10 using Code::Blocks 13.12, this project is not tested on Windows.

#How To Use
Assume that you have been registered to myfleet.moe.
<ol>
<li>Copy the table data content (without table header) of fleet list from myfleet.moe (For example from : https://myfleet.moe/user/19019916/ship).

<li>Run main.cpp with Code::Blocks IDE
